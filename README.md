#Post-mortem

I attempted to create a static blog with phrozn
http://www.phrozn.info/en/

Road blocks to development:
The project suggested support for twig, but was limited to a smaller subset of features, which excluded the ability to do things
such as multiple blocks, use of assetic, or running basic logic for includes.

This really is a layout-and-content system, it doesn't allow for modularity beyod a one-to-one switch.

Annoying things:
PEAR
